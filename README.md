# Todo Box

## Description

A minimalist todo list app designed for you to get stuff done!

Every front-end developer makes a todo list at some point in their life. This is mine. I was learning vanilla javascript at the time. Not perfect code but perfect for beginners to get a good look at.

Currently I use this at my day job to keep track of my tasks for the day. No deadlines, no overwhelming feelings, just the basics.
